### 3. Knitting the Body
Knit every row (garter stitch) to create the snake's body. Switch yarn colours every 10-15 rows to represent different genres or themes. Continue until the snake reaches your desired length.

### 4. Shaping the Head and Tail
To shape the snake:
- For the **head**, decrease stitches gradually by knitting two stitches together at the start of each row until 10 stitches remain.
- For the **tail**, do the same to taper the end.

### 5. Assembling the Snake
Once the knitting is complete:
1. Fold the piece lengthwise with the right sides together.
2. Sew the edges using a tapestry needle, leaving a small opening.
3. Turn the snake right side out and stuff it evenly with fiber fill.
4. Sew the remaining opening closed.
