# LinkedIn Post Draft

## Original Input:
- **Purpose**: I want to create a discussion if emojis should be added to a LinkedIn Headline on someones profile and if they are okay, is less is more?
- **Audience**: Everyone
- **Key Message**: Emojis in headlines yay or nay?
- **Supporting Points**: The screenshot attached
- **Hook**: Are emojis okay to use in your headline? if yes, then is less is more?
- **Call-to-Action**: Which one of these grab your attention, that's a rhetorical question I know, it's the top one but it wasn't for a good reason was it? 
- **Hashtags**: #YayorNay
