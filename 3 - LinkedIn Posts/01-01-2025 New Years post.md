I’m on the edge of my seat, waiting for the highly original "new year, new me" or "back in the office, refreshed and ready to crush my goals" posts. You know, the ones that flood LinkedIn every January.

As a devoted pessimist, I’ve always dismissed New Year’s resolutions as fluff, doomed to fail before lunch on January 2nd. But this year? I’m doubling down.

Resolutions often pile on stress, guilt, and unrealistic expectations. Most people barely think them through before committing to "run a marathon" or "read 52 books."


Don’t get me wrong goal setting is important! But it works best when it’s thoughtful, realistic, and manageable. Enter SMART goals. I first encountered them back at NatWest, a whole career ago. At the time, I didn’t care. Life was too busy convincing my newborn son that cricket is thrilling and squeezing in a cheeky game of FIFA. (Spoiler: I failed at both.)


Now I see SMART goals as brilliant. If you haven’t tried them, here’s a quick intro: https://lnkd.in/eb_V-iZ4. They’ve helped me shift from "hopeless dreamer" to "mildly competent adult."


My 2025 Goals:

Things I want to achieve:

• Read more, not just self-help. Maybe see why my family loves ACOTAR and Fourth Wing. Also, finish my manga before I’m crucified for buying more.

• Advance my career: become a Solutions Architect and maybe, just maybe, a Microsoft MVP.

• Actually finish a book.

• Crochet a bookworm I saw on Instagram.

• Stop letting Instagram inspire random projects.


Things I know I’ll achieve:

• Pass the PL-200 exam.

• Snack at my desk, regret it, and do it again.

• Make mistakes, learn (eventually), and repeat.

• Have bad days but realize later they weren’t so bad.


Things I’ve already failed at:

• Keeping leftover Papa John’s past January 1st. Zero regrets. **#PizzaIsForLifeNotJustForChristmas**

• And because I aim high, I tried to get my kids to make me breakfast in bed. Instead, my cat Atticus showed me his unchanged butthole. Thanks, buddy.


What about you? Any funny, realistic, or doomed-to-fail goals for 2025?


Share them below, I need inspiration while I snack on Christmas tree pretzels and pretend, I’m still on holiday (even though I’m back tomorrow). Urgh.
