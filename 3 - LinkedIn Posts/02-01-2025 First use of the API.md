## Ready-to-Post Format:

Alright folks, I’m about to dive into a topic that’s been making waves in the LinkedIn universe: Emojis in headlines. 🤔💭📝 (Don't worry, I'm not turning into an emoji enthusiast...yet.)

Some say it's a millennial invasion, others argue it adds personality. The screenshot attached may cause your eyes to go on a mini roller-coaster ride, but it begs the question: Are emojis okay to use in your LinkedIn headline? And if yes, is less indeed more? 

Do they add a splash of colour to the monochromatic professional landscape, or do they make your profile look like a teenager's text conversation? (I'm not judging, I've had my fair share of "LOL" and "OMG" moments.)

Which one of these headlines grabs your attention? That's a rhetorical question, I know, it's the top one. But was it for a good reason? Or was it because it looked like a unicorn threw up a rainbow on it? 

I'd love to get your thoughts on this. And remember, there's no right or wrong answer here - unless you use the eggplant emoji. Then we might need to have a chat. 😁 #YayorNay
