Terrible terrible upkeep on this I'm actually typing this half way through December already. What a sham this will be. Well let's go back and see what can be said about November:

Amalie parents evening, we raised a couple of concerns about accidents and some copied behaviour as well as talked about her ability in writing and reading. Me and Laura have discussed that we felt she wasn't being pushed at school or was showing how good she really could do. 

Vegan market was also this month and I go some more scrummy cheese from Sophia's delights. The kids all did secret Santa with each other and it was very cute then all picking things out for their chosen person. 

I also got myself a new winter coat from mountain warehouse, a lovely big one with mountains on it. Managed to walk out with the security tag still on it so had to go back haha. 

Esmae & Amalie birthdays this month! Went to Zak's for Esmae birthday and it was wonderful. Poor Dexter had to have a patty and salad followed by cold custard but he took it like a champ, I'm so proud of how conscious he is about his allergies. 

Lucifer and Atticus continue to have bad bellies but are so cute and they get on so well with all the kids. Oscar & Amalie are particularly smitten with them.
