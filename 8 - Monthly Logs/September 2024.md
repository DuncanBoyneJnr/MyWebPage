I need to start writing, I want to improve my writing as well as my overall learning. 

My success hinges on me being a more well rounded person, I want depth. Well read it something I inspire to be. I've been reading some of [[Mortimer Adler]] [[How to read a book]]. I'm still reading [[6 - Main Notes/Mythos|Mythos]] and [[1 - Rough Notes/The Histories|The Histories]] and really feeling like I'm getting immersed in Greek history and it's myths. 

In my professional life I finally feel like I'm coming to grips with Pump and Dynamics 365 in general. Agile is now fully bedded in and I very much enjoy working in that way and I feel like I can contribute in refinement sessions and sprint planning etc. 

I've been trying to technique of doing the opposite to my initial mental reaction, this is to help slow down and react less to what I perceive as a bad reaction from Laura.

The kittens have settled in so well and Atreyu is slowly coming around to having them around. Atticus is so affectionate, when I lay down he will come right up and boop me and rub his face on mine. Lucifer must be part lion I swear he is massive already and he is so soft and playful and is always licking me or rubbing himself on me.
