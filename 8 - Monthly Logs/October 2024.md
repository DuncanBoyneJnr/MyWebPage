I haven't written as much as I would have hoped, the same goes for reading, however I have started reading [[6 - Main Notes/American Gods|American Gods]] I've got far to many books started without finishing one. I want to power through and read [[Dorodehoro]] and get that finished and off my kindle. 

I've begun watching [[Orb  On the Movements of the Earth]] & [[Dan da dan]] both weird and wonderful in completely separate ways.

Me & Laura have started to watch [[From]] due to it being October and our love of all things Halloween Laura wanted us to watch some scary films and or series this month.

Having see that From was done by the makers of Lost I wanted to give it a go. 

We have been addicted since the very first episode, the level of suspense and wonder for each new episode has been immense and genuinely heart racing moments have had us "on the edge of our seats"

My mental health has taken a beating this month. I've really had to have a look at my whole lifestyle and make changes. One of those changes is quitting energy drinks, I already have the replacement in [[Space Goods]]. 

I do in general feel better more stable and I have much more energy, it's the habit and taste of energy drinks I'm struggling to replace. 

I'm also dieting again, [[Fast 800]] is my choice again for 2 weeks then onto [[5 2]]. 

Laura is also doing it again. 

We got the opportunity to go [[Foraging]] on 19/10/2024 it really was a great trip to Thetford, despite the weather. We managed to get some [[Puffball]], [[Amethyst Deceiver]] and some [[Blackening Polypore]].

Still very much enjoying working at Pump really feel as if I'm fully integrated and living up to my job title now.
