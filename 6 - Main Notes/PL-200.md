# PL-200

The functional consultant certificate, which is what my job is at Pump, I'm a Functional Consultant. 

Although [[Pump]] is based on Dynamics which itself isn't a part of the Power Platform, Dynamics is built with Power Platform.

It can be boiled down to having a good understanding of the whole power platform and how it can be used to help solve business needs in a quick and reliable way and to allow constant progression and upgrading (I need to fix this sentence). 

Functional Consultants should be able to evaluate and recommend Microsoft services based on business needs. Additionally they would be able to produce some of the low code / no code solutions for customers. They would also need to be able to present drafts/quotes for work based on a customers needs.
